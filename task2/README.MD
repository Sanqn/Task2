# Test task 2.
1. Initially, you need to track traffic from www.wildberries.ru and find HTTP
a request that sends data about the brand and name in JSON format
article. Product page example:
https://www.wildberries.ru/catalog/73512949/detail.aspx
2. Next, you need to implement an API that accepts an xlsx file with
articles (articles must be entered line by line in the first column) or
one article (not in the file, but only one value). The API should have
two inputs: a file or one value, one thing must be transferred.
3. The API must interact asynchronously with the found HTTP request in
the first paragraph and receive data about the product card. From the received data
need to make a PyDantic object.
4. The successful result of the API is the return of data about the brand and
article name in JSON format. Example: information about one article -
{"article": 123, "brand": "brand", "title": "Title"}; articles from file - [{"article": 1,
"brand": "Brand1", "title": "Title1"}, {"article": 2, "brand": "Brand2", "title": "Title2"}]

6. Perform database migrations with the command python manage.py migrate
7. Start the server with python manage.py runserver and follow the link
   Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
8. Follow the link indicated on the "wbdata" page: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/wbdata/"
9. Upload the xlsx file (for example, upload the test_file.xlsx file) or in the window (article) specify
